About this curriculum
=====================

This curriculum is created by the `TYPO3 Community Expansion Committee <https://typo3.org/community/teams/community-expansion>`__ as a starting point for our knowledge transfer and onboarding projects, such `in Rwanda <https://typo3.com/blog/report-on-typo3-based-government-websites-in-rwanda>`__. Read more about :ref:`who this curriculum is for and how it is being created <introduction>`.

.. note::
    **This is a curriculum, not a tutorial.** Therefore, it makes heavy use of external resources and does not itself constitute a tutorial or guide to TYPO3. For such materials, please refer to other TYPO3 documentation, tutorials, and books â€” some of which are linked throughout the curriculum.

Please feel free to contribute by adding content through pull requests or by submitting issues.
