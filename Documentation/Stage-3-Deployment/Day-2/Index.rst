Prerequisites
-------------


.. _s3-d2-theoretical-prerequisites

Theoretical prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This day assumes that you already know the following:

* The concepts and benefits of continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) workflows for quality assurance
* How an ideal deployment workflow and pipeline works for you, your team, and on a technology level
* How to configure TYPO3 for different environments.
* Understand how CI/CD practices improve software delivery and quality, streamline workflows, and reduce the risk of errors in production.
* Be able to differentiate between tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, and GitLab CI, and understand the scenarios in which each tool would be most effective.
* Recognize the components of effective deployment workflows and understand how to design these to enhance collaboration and efficiency.


.. _s3-d2-practical-prerequisites

Practical prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you start this day, please have the following things ready:

* Configured a simple pipeline that automates building, testing, and deploying TYPO3 applications.
* Conducted hands-on exercises to manage TYPO3 configuration files and adjust settings based on the specific requirements of each environment.
* Created and managed multiple environment setups, ensuring each is optimized for its purpose.

Theoretical goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By the end of this day, you should know the following:

* The difference between and benefits of differentiated testing, staging, and production/live environments
* Understand how and why to separate environments, including the isolation of changes and the progressive steps toward live deployment
* Understand the challenges associated with database versioning and migration
* How to perform database schema and data migrations in TYPO3 as part of a CD workflow
* Know the theoretical best practices for handling these changes seamlessly


.. _s3-d2-practical-goals

Practical goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By the end of this day, you should have completed the following:

* Configured TYPO3 differently for development, testing, staging, and production environments
* Implemented scripts or tools that manage database changes
* Ensure that migrations are smoothly and automatically handled during deployments
* Demonstrated the setup of each environment and validated that each configuration and migration strategy works as expected
