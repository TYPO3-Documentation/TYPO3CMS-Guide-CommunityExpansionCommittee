.. _s3-d3-l1-theoretical-prerequisites:

Theoretical prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This lesson assumes that you already know the following:

* The difference between and benefits of differentiated testing, staging, and production/live environments
* Understand how and why to separate environments, including the isolation of changes and the progressive steps toward live deployment
* Understand the challenges associated with database versioning and migration
* How to perform database schema and data migrations in TYPO3 as part of a CD workflow
* Know the theoretical best practices for handling these changes seamlessly


.. _s3-d3-l1-practical-prerequisites:

Practical prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you start this lesson, please have the following things ready:

* Configured TYPO3 differently for development, testing, staging, and production environments
* Implemented scripts or tools that manage database changes
* Ensure that migrations are smoothly and automatically handled during deployments
* Demonstrated the setup of each environment and validated that each configuration and migration strategy works as expected
