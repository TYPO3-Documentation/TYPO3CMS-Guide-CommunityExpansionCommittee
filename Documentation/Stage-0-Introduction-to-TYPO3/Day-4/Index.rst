======================================================
Day 4 — Development to Production: The TYPO3 Lifecycle
======================================================

.. _s5-d1-lessons:

Today's lessons
===============

Through practical demonstrations, instructors will show students how TYPO3 projects move from development to production.
Students will observe a deployment workflow in action, seeing how code changes are committed to Git, passed through automated tests, and deployed to staging and production environments.
Demonstrations will include showing the difference between environments, how caching affects performance, and how continuous integration tools automate quality checks.
These visual examples will prepare students for the in-depth deployment training in Stage 3.

Theoretical prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This day assumes that you already know the following:

* That TYPO3 websites are built and maintained using development environments and workflows
* That code can be tracked, shared, and managed using version control systems like Git
* That websites go through multiple stages—such as development, testing, and production—before going live


.. _s5-d4-practical-prerequisites:

Practical prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you start this day, please have the following things ready:

* Completed or reviewed Stage 0 Days 1–3 to understand TYPO3’s content and tooling foundations
* :ref:`The General Practical Prerequisites for Stage 0 <s0-practical-prerequisites>`

By the end of this day, you should know the following:

* How TYPO3 projects typically move from development to production in a professional workflow
* The differences between environment types and why they matter
* The basics of version control and why Git is essential in collaborative web development
* How continuous integration tools help automate quality checks and testing
* How caching and performance optimization impact website speed and reliability

By the end of this day, you should have completed the following:

* Observed a full deployment workflow for a TYPO3 project, from code changes to production
* Seen how environments are set up and switched between during development
* Watched examples of Git usage in a project setting and how code history is managed
* Viewed continuous integration processes running automated tests before deployment
* Reflected on how development practices affect live TYPO3 websites
