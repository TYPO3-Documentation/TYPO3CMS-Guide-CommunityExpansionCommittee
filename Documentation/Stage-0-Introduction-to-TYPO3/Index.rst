About this stage
================

This stage introduces TYPO3 and sets the foundation for your onboarding journey.
Day 1 explores the concept of content management systems, TYPO3’s history, and its key features through demos and real-world examples.
Day 2 provides a preview of the TYPO3 technology stack, including development tools like Docker, Composer, and Git.
Day 3 gives an early look at the TYPO3 backend, page structure, and content elements.
Day 4 presents the TYPO3 project lifecycle—from development to deployment—and introduces modern web development workflows.
Day 5 focuses on TYPO3’s long-term use, including updates, security, and community involvement.
By the end of this stage, you’ll have a clear understanding of what TYPO3 can do, how it fits into real projects, and what you’ll learn in the stages ahead.
